# Ansible on EC2

## Master set up

Install Ansible in master machine only.

	sudo su -
	apt upadate
	apt upgrade 
	apt install ansible  
	mkdir ansible
	
## Connect to hosts (agents)

Add key from host:

	mkdir .ssh
	cd .ssh

copy the key content (.pem) from the agent to the `.ssh`
(look into .ssh folder)

Change permissions to 400

	chmod 400 pptagent.key
	chmod 400 agent2.key

Make sure you can ssh to client

	ssh ubuntu@35.158.216.75 -i pptagent.key
	ssh ubuntu@54.93.248.245 -i agent2.key

## Hosts on Ansible machine
Make sure you can see the hosts in Ansible master machine:  

	cd ansible
	vim hosts

To connect each machine to master, copy private key from each machine to master .ssh or something like that â€¦
Edit hosts file - this is an inventory file of all agents connected to master

	[stam]  
	agent ansible_host=35.158.216.75 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/pptagent.key ansible_become=true
	agent2 ansible_host=54.93.248.245 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/agent2.key ansible_become=true


**[stam]** is the group name 

On the agents - install python `apt install python`

## Run command in agents via Ansible

Run the *hostname* command in all agents

	cd ansible
	ansible -i hosts agent -a "hostname"
**-a** run command
**-m** run module

You should see the results:
 ```bash
	root@master:~/ansible# ansible -i hosts agent2 -a "hostname"  
	agent2 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>  
	ip-172-31-40-73
```

Another way: 
```bash
	ansible -i "35.158.216.75, " --user ubuntu --private-key=~/.ssh/pptagent.key 35.158.216.75 -a "hostname"
```

To install nano on all agents do:
```bash
	sudo su -
	cd ansible
	ansible -i hosts agent --become -m package -a "name=nano"
```
This will install nano on all agents listed in the hosts file
